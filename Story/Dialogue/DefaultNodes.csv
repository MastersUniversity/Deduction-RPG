0,"Welcome to the Fortress of Igorim. I am sure you will live a nice life here among other supernatural beings such as yourself. There are many things you can do within your cell, as long as you are not concerned with the outside. If you wish for entertainment, you may go to the place where books and trinkets are kept. You do not have a roommate, the last person here was recently moved. They may have left something if you're curious. After you get accustomed to your quarters, don’t forget to stop and smell the flowers that were placed in your room. They were placed there for your enjoyment. That is all you must know. Enjoy your time here and chat with anyone who wanders close by. I wish you a wonderful stay.",
